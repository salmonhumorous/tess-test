# tesseract-flask-server

**Intoduction:**  
Hello, The aim of this repo is to extract information from images *online* using the power of Tesseract OCR.
You can upload a image and extract information from that image, all from google colab notebook provided in the repo.  
The UI is minimal to only support the required task, but I plan to polish it in the future.

**Steps:**  
All the necessary steps to install requirements and to launch the server are provided in the colab notebook.  
Follow the steps in the notebook to setup the server.
